As discussed on the phone, we have a coding test we'd like you to complete which forms the next stage of the interview process.

This is a fork which you can locally clone via Git.  Make your changes then push it back to origin as often as you need until you're happy it's complete.

In the root of the project is a file (Interview Coding Example.docx) with a class diagram and some broad tasks.  The questions are deliberately open ended in order to force you to make some choices of your own!

Please make what assumptions you think are needed based on your experiences with shopping and discounts. If you wish you could include a txt file with details of any assumptions made.

Let us know when you’ve finished and pushed back and we’ll take a look :)
